Act as a Senior DevOps Engineer. I am attempting to run the command $ARGUMENTS.

Your goal is to achieve an Exit Code 0. Analyze the ouput of the command, codebase and/or error logs and perform the following:
- Diagnose: Identify the root cause of the failure (syntax, dependency, type error, or logic).
- Fix: Rewrite the necessary code blocks to resolve the error.
- Verify: Explain why this fix will satisfy the compiler/interpreter and result in a successful build.

If multiple files are involved, clearly indicate the filename for every code block."
